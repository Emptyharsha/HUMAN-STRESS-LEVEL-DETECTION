*Title:* Human Stress Level Detection: Machine Learning Classification for Stress Detection

*Abstract:*  
The project focuses on using machine learning to predict human stress levels based on physiological data. Stress is a global health concern, and this project aims to provide personalized stress management interventions through predictive modeling. The system utilizes libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, employing algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

*Key Sections:*

1. *Introduction:*
   - *Domain:* Machine learning, particularly for data mining, natural language processing, and image recognition.
   - *Project Definition:* Stress significantly impacts health and well-being. The system monitors stress through physiological data to detect abnormal behavior indicative of stress.
   - *Proposed Solution:* Data from physiological monitoring devices is stored and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to predict stress. This helps doctors intervene early for better treatment.

2. *Related Work:*
   - The project builds on machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, k-NN, and Random Forest, which are applied to data from social media or physiological sensors to detect stress.
   - *Sentiment Analysis:* Identifies emotional tones from text data, particularly social media posts, to detect stress and depression.

3. *Architecture Design:*
   - Involves attributes like snoring rate, heart rate, oxygen levels, and body temperature to detect stress.
   - Steps include data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying machine learning models like Decision Trees and Random Forest.

4. *Algorithms:*
   - *Decision Trees:* Easy to interpret, used for stress classification.
   - *Random Forest:* An ensemble learning method for improving prediction accuracy.
